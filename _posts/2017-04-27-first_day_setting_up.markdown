Setup day and learn to say hello with my new editor, LEARN, which is an ATOM editor. Getting excited to meet other people who have the same interest like me. Thank God for this opportunity and I hope that I will be able to continue with the rest of the program. 

After setting up, I finally able to start on the first lesson proper. I think this would be a good take away here.

PSEUDO-CODE FOR TIC TAC TOE
*
The general procedure for Tic Tac Toe is as follows:*

* Create a structure to store and represent the state of the board.
* Welcome the players.
* Get the user's move in the form of some input.
* Make sure their move is valid.
* Check to see if the game has been won or came to a draw.
* Change the player turn and let the next player make a move.
* Repeat until the game is over.
